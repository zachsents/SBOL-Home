Installation recipie at https://linux4one.com/how-to-install-apache-tomcat-9-on-centos-7/

Had to set java variables up by hand in the tomcat systemd unit file (tomcat.service):
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.222.b10-1.el7_7.arm/

tomcat.service is installed in /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service

The installation recipie is flawed. Had to change the 'latest' directory to 'enabled',
which points to the actual symlink we created
